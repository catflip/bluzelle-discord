7. after you see something like below you successfully added your bot into your server

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125549449-b982800b-1401-4c3f-8332-7b90c1964e55.png)

8. this bot still can't do nothing we need to run the server whether its in local or in our vps see how to set it up down below

# Tutorial to setup local development

1. after you clone this repo, create an environment variable called `.env` and put it in `src` folder you can see the `.env.example` for example of variable that need to be added in order for this bot to work

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_INVITE=
WEBSITE=
```

you can get `DISCORD_TOKEN` variable if you go to `https://discord.com/developers/applications` and go to your bot application.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125549712-0a64fc2c-d32c-433f-a008-e82419960f85.png)

copy that token and put it in `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable, for the `DISCORD_INVITE` variable you can go to oauth2 on your discord application dashboard then copy paste the discord invite url like below :

![tempsnip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125547780-e385bbe1-4c6c-403c-af40-47931b4b0f18.png)

in local you don't need to setup `WEBSITE` environment variable as it is used for our bot to know which website to go to when user click `COMMAND LIST` button on our discord server, to know what each command is for and to get to know example of how it look like, below is the example when you issue `/help` command in the discord server, `COMMAND LIST` button will show up:

![tempsnip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125548078-42e9c324-3202-40e0-aee1-52dd1cab044f.png)

and this is the example when that button clicked it will show this webpage :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125548358-7c27ac06-45fe-44d6-8cc6-f31a0fcb00e1.png)

3. After you done setting up your environment variable go to your vscode terminal, and issue this command :

```bash
npm install 
npx ts-node-dev src/index.ts
```
if it show `Ready!` in console your bot is ready to use

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125548655-26ba4eb5-996a-42ee-b8b3-f503c826019d.png)

and then after that if you see your discord server, your bot is now online which means we can interact with it

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125549850-40fd3099-76eb-48da-b5de-db371c321a4e.png)

4. If you want to show the slash command that can be used on this server you need to issue `!deploy` command first, see below for example:

![command](https://i.gyazo.com/d31b846559c8f8c89c786f40cb370108.gif)

5. now you can see list of command that you can use, this bot server is using the latest [slash command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#:~:text=Images-,Slash%20Commands,features%20as%20you%20add%20them.) by discord which make it easy to issue a command, try to use `/help` command like below :

![image](https://i.gyazo.com/c2a4055a68a1e6bf8fc4b34fe159a15e.gif)

6. if you click on `COMMAND LIST` button basically you will go to a blank page in `http://localhost:3000/commands`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125551416-8f7d55c5-a90b-4e3e-840b-7d0238fc4e9e.png)

7. so in order to run the frontend issue this command in new terminal but in the same folder :

```
cd discord-page
npm install
npm run dev
```

8. Now when you go to `localhost:3000` or when clicking `COMMAND LIST` button in discord server you will see something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62529025/125551586-a26aff62-8678-434e-b316-770021512389.png)

9. now you can edit the code whatever you like it, because this discord bot is using typescript,you can easily see the type and some of the desciprtion of what particular command does.

# Run the discord server bot in vps

1. in order to run this on vps you need to ssh to your vps first after that you need to run this command in your terminal :

```
git clone https://github.com/spiritbro1/bluzelle-discord.git
cd bluzelle-discord
sudo su
```
2. run this command `cp .env.example .env` to create an `.env` file
3. edit this `.env` file just like you edit it in local the different is you should add the `WEBSITE` variable with the domain that goes to your ip address or just use your ip address, so the `WEBSITE` environment variable will be like this `http://<your ip address>` or `http://<your domain name>`

```
DISCORD_TOKEN= # same as in local dev
DISCORD_TOKEN= # same as in local dev
WEBSITE=# http://<your domain or ip address> for example http://bluzelle-discord.com or http://61.22.22.21
```

4. then run `bash build.sh` wait for it to complete after it complete go to your vps ip address or domain name and you will see the exact same frontend that you get via local development you will also need to issue a `!deploy` command in your discord server in order for you to use the slash command
